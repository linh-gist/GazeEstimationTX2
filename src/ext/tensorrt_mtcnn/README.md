Demo #2: MTCNN
--------------

This demo builds upon the previous one.  It converts 3 sets of prototxt and caffemodel files into 3 TensorRT engines, namely the PNet, RNet and ONet.  Then it combines the 3 engine files to implement MTCNN, a very good face detector.

Assuming this repository has been cloned at "${HOME}/project/tensorrt_demos", follow these steps:

0. Build the Cython code. Install Cython if not previously installed.

   ```shell
   $ sudo pip3 install Cython
   $ cd ${HOME}/project/tensorrt_demos
   $ make
   ```

1. Build the TensorRT engines from the pre-trained MTCNN model.  (Refer to [mtcnn/README.md](https://github.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos/blob/master/mtcnn/README.md) for more information about the prototxt and caffemodel files.)

   ```shell
   $ cd ${HOME}/project/tensorrt_demos/mtcnn
   $ make
   $ ./create_engines
   ```

2. Build the Cython code if it has not been done yet.  Refer to step 3 in Demo #1.

3. Run the "trt_mtcnn.py" demo program.  For example, I grabbed from the internet a poster of The Avengers for testing.

   ```shell
   $ cd ${HOME}/project/tensorrt_demos
   $ python3 trt_mtcnn.py --image ${HOME}/Pictures/avengers.jpg
   ```

   Here's the result (JetPack-4.2.2, i.e. TensorRT 5).

4. The "trt_mtcnn.py" demo program could also take various image inputs.  Refer to step 5 in Demo #1 for details.
