/**
 * @brief A struct containing a 3D shape model's edge topology.
 *
 * This struct contains all edges of a 3D mesh, and for each edge, it
 * contains the two faces and the two vertices that are adjacent to that
 * edge. This is used in the iterated closest edge fitting (ICEF).
 *
 * Note: The indices are 1-based, so 1 needs to be subtracted before using
 * them as mesh indices. An index of 0 as first array element means that
 * it's an edge that lies on the mesh boundary, i.e. they are only
 * adjacent to one face.
 * We should explore a less error-prone way to store this data, but that's
 * how it is done in Matlab by the original code.
 *
 * adjacent_faces.size() is equal to adjacent_vertices.size().
