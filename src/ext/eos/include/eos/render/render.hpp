/**
 * This file implements a software renderer conforming to OpenGL conventions. The
 * following are implementation notes, mostly for reference, or as a reminder of
 * what exactly is going on. Don't try to understand them :-)
 *
 * The renderer was initially based on code by Wojciech Sterna
 * (http://maxest.gct-game.net/content/vainmoinen/index.html), however, it has since
 * then been completely rewritten. Still I'd like to thank him for making his code
 * available and bravely answering my questions via email.
 *
 * Coordinate systems:
 * When specifying the vertices: +x = right, +y = up, we look into -z.
 * So z = 0.5 is in front of 0.0.
 * Z-Buffer:
 *
 * Shirley: Specify n and f with negative values. which makes sense b/c the points
 * are along the -z axis.
 * Consequences: notably: orthogonal(2, 3): Shirley has denominator (n-f).
 * In what space are the points in Shirley after this?
 * OGL: We're in the orthographic viewing volume looking down -z.
 * However, n and f are specified positive.

 * B/c the 3D points in front of the cam obviously still have negative z values, the
 * z-value is negated. So: n = 0.1, f = 100; With the given OpenGL ortho matrix,
 * it means a point on the near-plane which will have z = -0.1 will land up
 * on z_clip (which equals z_ndc with ortho because w=1) = -1, and a point on
 * the far plane z = -100 will have z_ndc = +1.
 *
 * That's also why in the perspective case, w_clip is set to -z_eye because
 * to project a point the formula is $x_p = (-n * x_e)/z_e$ (because our near is
 * specified with positive values, but the near-plane is _really_ at -n); but now we
 * just move the minus-sign to the denominator, $x_p = (n * x_e)/-z_e$, so in the projection matrix we can use
 * the (positive) n and f values and afterwards we divide by w = -z_e.
 *
 * http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_projectionmatrix.html
 *
 * Random notes:
 * clip-space: after applying the projection matrix.
 * ndc: after division by w
 * NDC cube: the range of x-coordinate from [l, r] to [-1, 1], the y-coordinate from [b, t] to [-1, 1] and the z-coordinate from [n, f] to [-1, 1].
 *
 * Note/Todo: I read that in screen space, OpenGL transform the z-values again to be between 0 and 1?
 *
 * In contrast to OGL, this renderer doesn't have state, it's just a function that gets called with all
 * necessary parameters. It's easiest for our purposes.
 *
 * Here's the whole rendering pipeline:
 * Model space
 * -> model transforms
 * World space
 * -> camera (view/eye) transform
 * View / eye / camera space ("truncated pyramid frustum". In case of ortho, it's already rectangular.)
 * -> perspective/ortho projection
 * Clip coords (x_c, y_c, z_c, w_c); the z-axis is flipped now. z [z=-n, z=-f] is mapped to [-1, +1] in case of ortho, but not yet in case of persp (it's also flipped though), but the not-[-1,1]-range is fine as we test against w_c. I.e. the larger the z-value, the further back we are.
 * Do frustum culling (clipping) here. Test the clip-coords with w_c, and discard if a tri is completely outside.
 * Of the partially visible tris, clip them against the near-plane and construct the visible part of the triangle.
 * We only do this for the near-plane here. Clipping to the near plane must be done here because after w-division triangles crossing it would get distorted.
 * "Then, OpenGL will reconstruct the edges of the polygon where clipping occurs."
 * -> Then divide by the w component of the clip coordinates
 * NDC. (now only 3D vectors: [x_ndc, y_ndc, z_ndc]). nearest points have z=-1, points on far plane have z=+1.
 * -> window transform. (also, OGL does some more to the z-buffer?)
 * Screen / window space
 * Directly after window-transform (still processing triangles), do backface culling with areVerticesCCWInScreenSpace()
 * Directly afterwards we calculate the triangle's bounding box and clip x/y (screen) against 0 and the viewport width/height.
 * Rasterising: Clipping against the far plane here by only drawing those pixels with a z-value of <= 1.0f.
 *
 * OGL: "both clipping (frustum culling) and NDC transformations are integrated into GL_PROJECTION matrix"
 *
 * Note: In both the ortho and persp case, points at z=-n end up at -1, z=-f at +1. In case of persp proj., this happens only after the divide by w.
