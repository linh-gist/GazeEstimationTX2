# NOTE: It is recommended to use vcpkg (https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) to install the dependencies for eos.
# However, for users who wish to install the dependencies manually, this file might be helpful to set the library paths explicitly.

# Mechanism via FindLIB.cmake
# ==============================
# Boost:
# -------
# Windows: Download the pre-built binaries from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ for VS2017 (msvc-14.1 64bit).
# Either set the windows PATH variable to "<YOUR_BOOST_DIRECTORY>\lib64-msvc-14.1" and CMake will find it, or, set:
#set(BOOST_ROOT "C:/boost" CACHE PATH "Boost search location" FORCE)
# Linux: Boost can usually be installed via a package manager (e.g. apt-get install boost-all-dev) and this variable can be left uncommented.
#set(BOOST_ROOT "/home/user/boost/install" CACHE PATH "Boost search location" FORCE)


# Mechanism via ConfigLIB.cmake in 3rd party library directory
# ==============================
# OpenCV:
# -------
# Windows: Download the package from opencv.org, use 2.4.13 or newer (e.g. 3.x), which it include binaries for VS2017. Set this path accordingly.
#set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/opencv/install" CACHE PATH "Location of OpenCVConfig.cmake" FORCE)
# Linux: Usually can be left blank but it can be used if OpenCV is not found.
#set(OpenCV_DIR "/home/user/opencv/install/share/OpenCV" CACHE PATH "Location of OpenCVConfig.cmake" FORCE)
#
# Ceres:
# -------
#set(Ceres_DIR "C:/ceres/install-vs2017/CMake" CACHE PATH "Location of CeresConfig.cmake" FORCE)

# Set the path to the python interpreter if you want to build the python bindings and it doesn't find it automatically:
# ==============================
#set(PYTHON_EXECUTABLE "C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36/python.exe" CACHE PATH "Path to the python interpreter." FORCE)

# Set the path to the Matlab root directory if you want to build the Matlab bindings and it doesn't find Matlab automatically:
# ==============================
#set(Matlab_ROOT_DIR "/opt/matlab" CACHE PATH "Path to the Matlab installation directory." FORCE)

# Configuration options
# ==============================
set(EOS_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON CACHE BOOL "Build the example applications." FORCE)
set(EOS_BUILD_CERES_EXAMPLE OFF CACHE BOOL "Build the fit-model-ceres example (requires Ceres)." FORCE)
set(EOS_BUILD_UTILS OFF CACHE BOOL "Build utility applications." FORCE)
set(EOS_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION OFF CACHE BOOL "Build the library documentation." FORCE)
set(EOS_GENERATE_PYTHON_BINDINGS OFF CACHE BOOL "Build python bindings. Requires python to be installed." FORCE)
set(EOS_GENERATE_MATLAB_BINDINGS OFF CACHE BOOL "Build Matlab bindings. Requires Matlab with the compiler installed or the Matlab Compiler Runtime." FORCE)
