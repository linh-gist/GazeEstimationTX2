 * @brief Transparent conversion to and from Python for eos::core::Image.
 *
 * Numpy uses row-major storage order by default.
 * eos::core::Image uses col-major storage (like Eigen).
 * 
 * If given non-standard strides or something from numpy, probably doesn't work.
 * May need to .clone()? in numpy before passing to the C++ function.
